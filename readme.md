# Tharsis Documentation System

Tharsis is a system for generating technical documentation.
This is all part of a desire to spend more time on a project, so the
code will not be pretty to start.

## Milestone 1

The first milestone will be achieved when a static site is generated from
a collection of markdown files. This site should include a menu.
